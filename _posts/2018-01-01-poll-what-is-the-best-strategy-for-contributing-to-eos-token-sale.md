Hello everyone,

There has been a lot of discussion regarding the EOS token sale and game theory. It is time we take a poll to see what everyone thinks. This information will obviously create a feedback loop and may change your strategy or maybe suggest you rethink your assumptions.

Comment below with your opinions!

It would be nice if I could create polls directly on steemit!
