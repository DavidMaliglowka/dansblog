I was recently informed of a post on bitcointalk that many people suspected might be a secret launch of a new "ICO" for EOS.

Considering the confusion and the potential that almost $1M of BTC was given to the "donation address" I want to take measures to prevent this kind of subtle impersonation from hurting anyone else. I will not introduce any future projects through anonymous accounts.

##### Donation Address:

Looks like only 20 people funded it so far.

EOS Party!
----------

Just incase you missed the prior announcement, we will be throwing a party at the unveiling our new project, EOS. It will take place from May 22-25th at the the Consensus 2017 event in NYC. I am eager to connect in person with fellow developers and entrepreneurs.

We would like to thank everyone who reached out to claim the free tickets. We should be contacting you all shortly as I believe almost everyone was approved.
